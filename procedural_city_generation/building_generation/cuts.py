    Chooses a Cut for the creation of the floorplan from all available cuts.
    Every cut functions by adding/replacing values in the numpy array of
    the walls' vertices. There are two main cuts.
    All other cuts are a combination of these two cuts.
    The elementary cuts are::
        Ccut
        ------------        ----+   +----
                      == >      |   |
